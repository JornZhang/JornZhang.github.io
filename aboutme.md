I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, where I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Hongyu Zhao](https://zhaocenter.org/team.html). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from [Colorado State University](https://statistics.colostate.edu/) in 2025, where I was advised by Professor [Wen Zhou](https://wp.nyu.edu/rczw/) and co-advised by Professor [Haonan Wang](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~wanghn/). I have also had the honor of collaborating with Professor [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/), Professor [Fan Yang](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1031/2335.htm), and Professor [Lihua Lei](https://lihualei71.github.io/). Prior to CSU, I obtained a B.A. in Insurance ([School of Finance](https://finance.nankai.edu.cn/)) and an M.A.S. in Applied Statistics ([School of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.nankai.edu.cn/)) from Nankai University in 2016 and 2018, respectively.


### My research interests:
* High-dimensional statistics  
* Causal inference, interference, mediation analysis  
* Network analysis, graphical modeling  
* Tensor data analysis
